smallRNA_Portal
===============

A website to display smallRNA information, blast against the smallRNAs and visualize smallRNAs mapped onto a genome.

    Here you can ...
    ... search for smallRNAs
    ... blast against smallRNAs
    ... view all smallRNAs mapping onto an annotation
    ... view all annotations mapping onto a smallRNA
    ... view all smallRNAs using the same sequence
    ... view all smallRNAs in an experiment
    ... view all abundancies
    ... view all abundancies per experiment

There are detail pages for the smallRNAs and for each gene model. The gene model detail pages also have an interactive visualization depicting how the smallRNA coverage is distributed.

Parsing
-------

A whole perl based framework to parse

* cDNA,
* FASTA,
* GFF,
* TPLOT as well as
* testing of MySQL index speed and
* UnitTests

are available in the parsing directory.
